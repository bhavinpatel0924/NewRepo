Hi Everyone,

I hope this email finds you well. I am sending this email out because I was working with the Users, Brand, and Receipts data from Fetch Rewards and had some questions about it.

1) I noticed that for all the datasets that there were couple of columns that were missing data. I was wondering if it was missing at random or we didn't have the right entry for it, etc?

2) I also noticed that there was duplicate data and was wondering what the cause could be?

I would love to get a chance to speak with you about it.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Bhavin
